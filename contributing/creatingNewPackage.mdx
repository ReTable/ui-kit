# Creating a new package

We uses [plop](https://plopjs.com/) to provide scaffold of new packages.

## Commands

You can use scaffold in following way:

<Source code="pnpm scaffold:<type>" />

### `scaffold:component`

Generates a new React component package:

- package will have `ui-` prefix;
- package will be placed to the `components` directory;
- adds run configurations for Intellij Idea.

You can select type of styles which will use your package: plain CSS, [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/),
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), or [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/).

Our build system supports any of them without additional configuration, but selection of styles platform on generation
step will generate you different files.

### `scaffold:hook`

Generates a new React hook package:

- package will have `use-` prefix;
- package will be placed to the `hooks` directory;
- adds run configurations for Intellij Idea.

### `scaffold:library`

Generates a new library package:

- package will have no additional prefix;
- package will be placed to the `libraries` directory;
- adds run configurations for Intellij Idea.

## Templates

Template files of the scaffold located in the `.scaffold` directory.

Templates uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine.

## Configuration

You can configure generators and add a new one generator in the `plopfile.js`.
