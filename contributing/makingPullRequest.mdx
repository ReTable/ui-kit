# Making a pull request

Before you make a pull request read the following information.

### Commit convention

We use commit conventions. When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category<(package)>: message` in your commit message while using one of the following categories:

- `feat`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features;
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present);
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature;
- `perf`: all changes regarding performance improvements;
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing ones);
- `build`:all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies or the addition of new dependencies;
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e. Github Actions, CI system);
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for usage or a lib or cli usage);
- `style`: all changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (i.e. white spaces, formatting, missing semi-colons);
- `chore`: all changes to repository that do not fit into any of the above categories.

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
Angular Commit Message Guidelines.

### Steps to PR

1. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention `[type/scope]`. For example,
`feat/button-icon-support` or `docs/cli-typo`. `type` can be any conventional commit type.
2. Make and commit your changes following the [commit convention](#commit-convention). As you develop, you can run
`pnpm build --filter <package>` and `pnpm test --filter <package>` to make sure everything works as expected.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This will be used to generate a changelog
when we publish an update.
[Learn more about Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main/packages/cli).

> If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc., you can run `pnpm changeset add --empty` to generate an
> empty changeset file to document your changes.
