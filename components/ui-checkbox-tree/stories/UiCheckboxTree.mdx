# UiCheckboxTree

That tree component allows to render checkbox tree.

Also, it handles expand/collapse operations inside.

<Canvas of={Stories.Tree} />

## Options

### `tree`

The `tree` property contains a tree data to render. You can define type of ids, and data which expected in the tree
structure.

Ids of items must be unique and has type `number` or `string`.

See typings for more information.

### `labelOf`

Function which will be called to get label of node.

### `selected`

Set of leaf's ids which is checked.

### `onChange`

Handler which accepts a set of checked leaf's ids.

The `UiCheckboxTree` always calls this callback with full set of checked ids, not only ids which checked after the latest
user's action.

### `className`

You can provide custom CSS class which will be assigned to the root element.

### `testId`

We allow to assign test ID for the root element.

## Empty Branches

If branch is empty, it will be disabled.

<Canvas of={Stories.EmptyBranch} />

## Disabled State

Each item can have `isDisabled` property.

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledLeafs} />

If all items are disabled, then the `Select All` is disabled too.

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledHeader} />

If branch is disabled, then all children is disabled too.

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledBranch} />

If branch's children are disabled, then branch is disabled too.

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledChildren} />

If user toggle branch or `Select All` when disabled items is presented, then disabled items aren't changed.
