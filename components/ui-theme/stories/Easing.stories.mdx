# Easing

Each timing function has two motions:

- **productive**: this motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while remain subtle and out of the way.
                  Productive motion is appropriate for moments when the user needs to focus on completing task.
- **expressive**: this motion delivers enthusiastic, vibrant, and highly visible movement. Use expressive motion
                  for significant moments such as opening a new page, clicking the primary action button, or when the
                  movement itself conveys a meaning. System alerts and the appearance of notification boxes are great
                  cases for expressive motion.

## Usage

CSS: `var(--tbl--easing--<standard|entrance|exit>--<productive|expressive>)`

Sass: `$easing--<standard|entrance|exit>--<productive|expressive>`

vanilla-extract: `uiTheme.easing.<standard|entrance|exit>.<productive|expressive>`

<br />

## Standard

Use standard timing functions when an element is visible whole time of motion.

<EasingsPreview expressive={uiTheme.easing.standard.expressive} productive={uiTheme.easing.standard.productive} />

<br />

## Entrance

Use entrance timing functions when an element appeared in process of a motion. For example, when a user
opens a dropdown or a dialog.

<EasingsPreview expressive={uiTheme.easing.entrance.expressive} productive={uiTheme.easing.entrance.productive} />

<br />

## Exit

Use exit timing functions when an element exit from scene in process of a motion. For example, when a user
closes a dropdown or a dialog.

<EasingsPreview expressive={uiTheme.easing.exit.expressive} productive={uiTheme.easing.exit.productive} />
