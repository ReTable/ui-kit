# UiTree

Tree component allows to render tree with user defined leafs and branches elements in one dimension list.

Also, it handles expand/collapse operations inside.

We use our custom components to render example below.

<Canvas of={Stories.Tree} />

## Options

### `tree`

The `tree` property contains a tree data to render. You can define type of ids, and data which expected in the tree
structure.

Ids of items must be unique and has type `number` or `string`.

See typings for more information.

### `branchComponent`

The `branchComponent` expects a React component which will be used to render branch element.

We provide following properties for branches:

- `id` - ID of an item;
- `data` - data of an item;
- `level` - nesting level of branch starting from `0`;
- `isExpanded` - flag which says about expanded branch or collapsed;
- `onToggle` - callback which used to toggle branch, and which could be assigned to the interactive element inside of
               component.

### `leafComponent`

The `leafComponent` expects a React component which will be used to render leaf element.

We provide following properties for leafs:

- `id` - ID of an item;
- `data` - data of an item;
- `level` - nesting level of leaf starting from `0`.

### `pattern` and `match`

This is a pair of properties.

The `pattern` is string value which contains a pattern which will be provided to the `match` function.

The `match` function is predicated, which takes node and pattern, and returns boolean flag.

If one of them will not be provided, or the `pattern` will be is an empty string, then search will be ignored
completely.

### `className`

You can provide custom CSS class which will be assigned to the root element.

### `testId`

We allow to assign test ID for the root element.
